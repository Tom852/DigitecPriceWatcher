# DigitecPriceWatcher
This is a little task tray application which periodically checks prices of products on Digitec / Galaxus (Swiss internet shop) and horns with a more or less aggressive alert if the price drops below a certain limit.

I made this application in response to the very volatile prices and I don't like paying more than I have to.

The app is quite 80/20 and may not work in all cases, but generally does its job.

# How to install
Download the latest release, extract it, and put the executable into autostart.
